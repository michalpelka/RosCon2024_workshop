Welcome to the Hand-Held Mobile Mapping System for Large-Scale Surveys workshop.
During the workshop attendees are expected to perform mapping tasks with handheld devices and 
process results.
The device is an open hardware project available here: [mandeye](https://github.com/JanuszBedkowski/mandeye_controller).

You can assemble your device, but we will bring a dozen devices for you.

## Notes ðŸ’¡
> **_NOTE1:_** Please revisit this page before the workshop to get the latest updates

> **_NOTE2:_** All refered gitthub projects [mandeye](https://github.com/JanuszBedkowski/mandeye_controller),

## Prerequesities

The [project HDMapping](https://github.com/MapsHD/HDMapping) is supported for Windows and Linux.
We recommend the following distributions:
- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ubuntu 24.04

The machine you are running should have plenty of RAM. 
For small-scale experiments, 16 GB should be enough. 
Consider adjusting virtual memory to utilize disk space, details can be found [here](https://github.com/MapsHD/HDMapping/blob/main/doc/virtual_memory.md)
